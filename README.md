Hi there! 👋 I’m Faiz Ul Hassan

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub, where my code works… most of the time!

👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a software developer, digital problem-solver, and a certified bug whisperer 🐛. When I’m not staring at my screen, debugging code, or wondering why something worked yesterday but not today, you’ll probably find me:

	•	✨ Building awesome projects
	•	🛠️ Breaking (and fixing) things with code
	•	☕ Drinking way too much coffee for my own good

🔧 My Toolkit

Here’s a taste of the magic (and chaos) I bring to my projects:

	•	Languages: Ruby, JavaScript, Python, [insert a few more buzzwords here]
	•	Frameworks: Rails, React, Node.js (because sleep is for the weak)
	•	Tools: Git, Docker, Sidekiq (where queues go to party), and Redis (like a tiny database with superpowers)

📜 Fun Facts

	•	🔥 I once spent two hours debugging just to realize I used spaces instead of tabs. I call it character building.
	•	🤖 If there’s an API, I’ll integrate it. Need to control your lights from your fridge? I’m your person.
	•	🎩 Proficient in “Works on My Machine” certified solutions.

🚀 Current Projects

You can find me working on projects that push my limits and (hopefully) inspire others. From scalable backend systems to interactive front-end apps, I’m here for all the tech adventures!

💬 Let’s Chat!

I’m always up for connecting with fellow developers, chatting about new ideas, or debating tabs vs. spaces (it’s tabs, obviously). Feel free to reach out or drop a message if you share my passion for tech and memes!

Thanks for stopping by! 👋
